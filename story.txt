Once upon a time there was a man named Tim. he lived in a far off land
where everything was very far away.

One day, He was hungry.

He decided that he wanted to eat tacos. He preferred soft shells but they only
had hard shells in this far land. He was unsatisfied but he had no choice. With limited resources he made the best use out of what he had. His resources started depleting.

Soon there was only one weeks supply remaining.
